            <p>
              The goal of this design project is to build a linear stage with open-loop control, capable of moving 0.5kg to predefined locations along its path. This report is divided into eight sections: the <a href="#work">Work Description</a>, <a href="#principles">Principles of Operation</a>, <a href="#construction">Mechanical Construction</a>, <a href="#circuitry">Circuitry</a>, <a href="#code">Code</a>, <a href="#tests">Test Procedure</a>, <a href="#results">Test Results</a>, and <a href="#motion">Loaded Motion Cycle</a>. The above can be used as a table of contents by clicking the desired section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Work was largely organized in the same fashion as the report&rsquo;s heirarchy; the rails were assembled as described in the <a href="#construction">mechanical construction</a> section and code was written for initial testing (described in the <a href="#code">code</a> and <a href="#tests">test procedure</a> / <a href="#results">results</a> sections). This was followed with the implementation of a limit switch&mdash;wired in as per the <a href="#circuitry">circuitry</a> section, and the code modified accordingly. Finally, the video of the <a href="#motion">stage in motion</a> was produced, integrating all prior work and demonstrating functionality meeting that which was set out within the goals.
            </p>
        <div class="subhead small-caps" id="principles">
            <a href="#principles">Principles of operation</a></div>
            <p>
              A linear stage consists of a few key elements: the rails, screw, and motor. A stage is placed upon guide blocks on the rail, and connected to a nut on the lead screw. As such, when the screw is turned by the stepper motor, screw converts the rotational motion of the motor into linear translation along the axis of the rails, and subsequently pulls the stage along.
            </p>
            <p>
              The stepper motor itself functions by the periodic polarization of patterned electromagnets, in a sequence that pulls the rotor about a full rotation in discrete steps. In this project, the sequencing of polarization is controlled via an Arduino with a motor shield, running the code outlined below. In the full-step regime, coils within the motor are polarized one at a time, with the step resolution limited to the number of times the coils are patterned. In the half-step regime, this step resolution is doubled by energizing more than one coil at a time, transiently pulling the rotor to positions between coils as additional &ldquo;steps&rdquo;.
            </p>
        <div class="subhead small-caps" id="construction">
            <a href="#construction">Mechanical construction</a></div>
            <p>
              To construct the stage, I began sliding the guide blocks onto the rails&mdash;two per&mdash;and the nut onto the lead screw, and then affixed the mounts and bearings to the rails and lead screw respectively, tightening their set screws with an allen key. Due to the lack of fastening hardware included with the shipment, I improvised mostly with hot glue and tape. Aligning the mounting holes of the rotary bearing and the rail mounts, I dripped hot glue down the centered holes and allowed it to cure, forming a cast that&mdash;while not preventing vertical translation&mdash;prevented any horizontal translation in the X or Y directions: the primary direction for which the stage would have to resist forces under normal operation.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the rails and screw assembled, I next mounted a 5&times;5&Prime; foam-board platform to the guide blocks and nut using hot glue, dripping the glue over the lead screw nut while the stage was inverted so as to bridge the gap between the nut and the platform, and fix the nut both rotationally and translationally to the platform; if only held captive translationally but allowed to rotate freely, the nut would simply rotate in tandem with the lead screw, and the platform would not translate. Next, the motor coupling was affixed to the end of the lead screw with its internal set screw, and the stepper motor connected on its other end similarly. The whole assembly was transfered to a strip of cardboard and held down by clear packing tape, running over the feet of the rail stands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The stepper motor was then wired to the Arduino&rsquo;s motor shield. At this point, an initial iteration of the <a href="#code">code</a> was written, and all <a href="#tests">tests</a> were run. Finishing the construction consisted solely of <a href="#circuitry">mounting and wiring in a limit switch</a>, the details of which are below.
            </p>

            <img src="/img/limitswitch.png" id="limitwire" alt="Limit switch wired into Arduino with a pull-up resistor."/>
            <p>
              Above pictured is the wiring schema for the limit switch. A pull-up resistor of 10k&#8486;s is connected to the Arduino&rsquo;s 5V power, and then split back to digital pin ten and to ground through the switch. Given this: when the switch is depressed, the pin will read LOW, when released, it will read HIGH. The only other wired component of this project is the stepper motor, which connects to the coil A/B terminals of the motor shield in a 1&#8209;to&#8209;1 fashion. All other circuitry is internal to the motor shield and Arduino.

                Both the full and half step code are within this program, switching achieved by setting the global flag to either FULL or HALF. Serial readout is tab-delineated, of the format: time [s], steps, current in coil A [mA], coil in current B [mA].
