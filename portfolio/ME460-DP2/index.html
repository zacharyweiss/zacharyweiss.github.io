      <p>
        The goal of this design project is to build a linear stage with closed-loop control, capable of moving 0.5kg to predefined locations along its path. This project builds upon the work of <a href="/portfolio/ME460-DP1">ME460 Design Project #1</a>, replacing the linear stage&rsquo;s stepper motor with a DC motor controled via a PD control schema. The following report is divided into eight sections: the <a href="#work">Work Description</a>, <a href="#circuitry">Circuitry</a>, <a href="#control">Control Algorithm</a>, <a href="#code">Code</a>, <a href="#results">Test Results</a>, and <a href="#motion">Loaded Motion Cycle</a>. The above can be used as a table of contents by clicking the desired section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only physical construction required was the removal of the stepper motor, and mounting of the DC motor via a flexible coupling. The motor was wired into an Arduino motor shield as per the <a href="#circuitry">circuitry</a> section. The motor is controlled via a simple PID schema, only making use of the PD terms, as described in the <a href="#control">control algorithm</a> section; this schema is implemented in the <a href="#code">code</a> section, its homing sequenced tested in the <a href="#results">test results</a>, and footage of the sequence provided in the <a href="#motion">loaded motion cycle</a>.

      <p>
        Above pictured is the wiring schema for the limit switch and DC motor. The mini-breadboard at the top is symbolic of the motor shield; it recieves external power, the motor negative and positive are wired in, and controlling signals are provided via pins <code>3</code>, <code>9</code>, and <code>12</code> (connected via the shield, as represented by the grey wires). Ground is common across the shield and Arduino. The encoder wires directly into pins <code>2</code> and <code>7</code>, as well as the Arduino <code>5V</code> and <code>GND</code> supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limit switch is wired in in the same fasion as in <a href="/portfolio/ME460-DP1">Design Project #1</a>: a 10k&#8486; pull-up resistor is connected to the Arduino&rsquo;s <code>5V</code> power, and then split back to digital pin <code>10</code> and to <code>GND</code> through the switch. Given this: when the switch is depressed, the pin will read <code>LOW</code>, when released, it will read <code>HIGH</code>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        All other circuitry is internal to the motor shield and Arduino.

      <p>
        PID control is the most rudimentary of control schemas, easily implemented on the smallest microcontrollers, or even in a fully analog fashion. It consists of three terms: the proportional, integrative, and derivative control terms. Each takes an error signal, and by some tuned coefficient, feeds a response back into the system, seeking to minimize the error. In the proportional term, the error is simply the difference between the target value and the current value. In the integrative term, accumulated proportional error over time is considered, with proportional error that has lingered for longer having a higher weight; this is most useful in reducing residual error. In the derivative term, it considers the rate at which the proportional error is changing, most useful for preventing overshoot of a target value.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project&rsquo;s deliverables simply called for proportional control, but due to significant observed overshoot at proportional coefficient values that avoided significant system lag, especially from a stopped state, I decided to implement a simple derivative control term as well, which can be enabled or disabled by use of the global flag <code>use_deriv</code> within the code. The implementation of this schema into code is as follows.

      <p>
        As mentioned in the <a href="#control">control algorithm</a> section, derivative control can be turned on and off by setting the global flag <code>use_deriv</code> to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Serial readout is tab-delineated, of the format: time [ms], motor voltage output [0-255], current speed [rpm], and encoder pulses. There are 374 pulses of the encoder per rotation, and the lead screw&rsquo;s pitch is 8mm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The broad strokes of the program are: <code>setup()</code> defines the pin inputs, turns everything off, and waits for user input with the switch, upon which there is a delay of 1s before starting the homing sequence. It additionally attachs an interrupt to pin <code>2</code>, such that pulses of the encoder may be accurated counted via the <code>count()</code> function. The <code>loop()</code> seeks to execute the homing regime of: 35mm/s towards the motor, until the limit switch is depressed, 20mm/s away from the motor for a distance of 10mm, move towards the motor once again at the slowest speed controllable (6mm/s) until the limit switch is pressed, and away once more at 10mm/s for 30mm. These speeds and distances are stored in global vars, converted via the function <code>mmToRPM()</code> into RPM, and passed to the function <code>setSpeed()</code>. The <code>setSpeed()</code> function contains the PD control logic, taking the RPM target speed, comparing it to the current speed as found by <code>getSpeed()</code>, and feeding back into <code>v_motor</code>, which is then applied to the motor via an <code>analogWrite()</code> to pin <code>3</code>. The <code>getSpeed()</code> function is passed the time for which it is to sample, records the starting pulse count, waits for the specified time, reads the ending pulse count, subtracts the two, divides by the sampling time, and applies unit conversions to return speed in RPM. Comments in the code above explain each function to a greater depth.

        The aforementioned Serial monitor readouts from the homing sequence were parsed and plotted within Excel to produce the following results.

      <img src="/img/ME460-DP2/disp.png" id="linDisp" alt="Plot of linear displacement vs. time"/>
      <p>
        Above is the linear displacement over time. Zero is the home position of the platform (30mm away from the motor and limit switch), with the positive direction towards the motor, and the negative direction away.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/ME460-DP2/vel.png" id="linVel" alt="Plot of linear speed vs. time"/>
      <p>
        Above is the absolute linear speed of the carraige (directionality of velocity not represented). Within the plot, there are two evident outlying points: the first sudden dip is likely a measurement / weak wiring connection; the second is likely a result of insufficient measurement frequency, as new readings are only made every tenth of a second (and velocity must drop to zero and back up each time the carriage switches direction), the same rate at which the applied motor voltage is recalculated. The minor overshoot, and the damping of the derivative term is evident most clearly in the final part of the regime, from 4 seconds onward, where it oscillates slightly about the target speed of 10mm/s.

        Below is a recording of the linear stage carrying a partially-filled Mason jar weighing in at 0.82kg. The program is triggered by an initial press of the limit switch, whereupon it travels along the homing sequence described in the <a href="#code">code</a> section.
